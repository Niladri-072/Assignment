Sentiment Analysis with BERT
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The BERT model, known for its state-of-the-art performance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), is fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments.

Features
Data Preparation: Loads and preprocesses the IMDB movie reviews dataset.
Tokenization: Converts text data into tokens compatible with BERT.
Model Architecture: Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model with an additional classification layer.
Training and Fine-Tuning: Trains the model on the IMDB dataset and tunes hyperparameters.
Deployment: Provides an interactive user interface for real-time sentiment prediction.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Transformers
Keras Tuner
IPyWidgets
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pip install transformers tensorflow keras-tuner ipywidgets matplotlib
Usage
Data Preparation
Load the IMDB dataset.
Convert sentiment labels to numeric values (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Tokenization
Use the BERT tokenizer to convert text data into tokens suitable for BERT.

Training
Create the BERT model with a classification layer.
Define a custom training loop to train the model.
Use Keras Tuner to search for optimal hyperparameters.
Evaluate the model's performance on validation and test sets.
Deployment
Load the trained model and tokenizer.
Create an interactive user interface with IPyWidgets.
Predict sentiment for user-provided movie reviews.
Example
To test the model locally:

python
Copy code
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertForSequenceClassification
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the saved model and tokenizer
model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('/path/to/save/best_model')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('/path/to/save/best_model')

def predict(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="tf", truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
    prediction = model(inputs)
    logits = prediction['logits'].numpy()
    probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits, axis=1).numpy()[0]
    predicted_class = np.argmax(probabilities)
    predicted_probability = probabilities[predicted_class]
    return predicted_class, predicted_probability

text = "The movie was fantastic!"
prediction, probability = predict(text)
print(f"Prediction: {'Positive' if prediction == 1 else 'Negative'} with probability {probability:.4f}")
